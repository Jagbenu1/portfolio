# portfolio
My portfolio, made for [jacquesagbenu.com/home](jacquesagbenu.com/home)

Tools I used to make this site

- [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) - hosting is pretty easy with this hosting service(though it isnt free)

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - a lot of Bootstrap was added to make this appear better than it would have been without it.

- [scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - the SCSS helped keep the structure of my stying in perspective and made it simpler to create all of the styling for the pages.
